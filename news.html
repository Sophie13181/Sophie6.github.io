    <h1>My Summer Holiday</h1>
    
    <h3>The <em>second day</em> of my summer holiday</h3>
    
    <p>I was going to go to the movie theatre with my friends, to go for a walk. The next day my grandma called me and said I needed to go to the village and help with cleaning.<br> 
    We were also going to visit my great-grandfather.</p>

    <p>The first trouble we had was traffic jams. There was an accident, and we were on the road for 5 hours! It was boiling. It was awful.</p>

    <p>We arrived at the place, and everything <strong>was great</strong>. I helped a lot, we sometimes went for walks, ate ice cream. We were going home soon, but the car broke down.<br> 
    But my grandfather <cite>fixed it</cite>, and we went home.</p>

    <p><em>This is how the first two weeks of my last summer went.</em></p>
